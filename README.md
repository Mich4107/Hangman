# Hangman

The program makes a word that the Player have to guess. The player will guess the letters in the word (RU). If the player does not guess the correct letter, then a part of the body of the person who is hanging on the gallows is drawn. The player continues to guess the letters until he guesses the whole word or the full body of the man on the gallows is drawn. If the player guesses the word, then he wins, if the full body of the man on the gallows is drawn, then he loses.
